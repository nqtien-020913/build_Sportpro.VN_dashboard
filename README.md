# BUILD SPORTPRO.VN DASHBOARD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Context

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Sportpro.VN** (formerly known as **Salehub.com.vn**) is an e-commerce platform developed by **SPORTPRO Vietnam Co., Ltd**. — a subsidiary of **TSN Co., Ltd.** The platform was launched with the goal of boosting sales of overstock and off-season products through an outlet sales model, thereby improving the company’s inventory management efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It offers authentic products from reputable global brands such as _**adidas, Nike, Converse, and SOR**_ at highly competitive prices. Currently, Sportpro’s warehouse system is integrated with **six retail stores** across the South Central and Central Highlands regions of Vietnam.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The market for **premium sports fashion products** in Vietnam is quite diverse, yet the market share is largely dominated by major players like **SuperSport** and **MaxxSport**. These companies serve as **Sportpro’s direct competitors**, both in terms of physical retail presence and in the online e-commerce space.

### 1.2. Situation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context of booming e-commerce, **data plays a crucial role** in helping businesses understand customer behavior, optimize operations, and enhance overall business performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To accelerate growth in 2025, **Sportpro.VN** plans to implement an **omnichannel strategy**, with a strong focus on expanding sales through **TikTok Shop**, particularly via **Livestreaming**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the **Project Director** and **Business Development team** at Sportpro.VN are working on **developing a dashboard** to monitor business performance and assess the effectiveness of this initiative, enabling timely and data-driven strategic decisions.
